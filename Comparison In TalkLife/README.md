# Comparison with other methods

This folder contains the code we used to generate the results using Spectral clustering, DCSBM, and SBM. In particular, the results from SBM and DCSBM are based on the package developped by [Funke T, Becker T (2019) Stochastic block models: A comparison of variants and inference methods. PLoS ONE 14(4): e0215296.] (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215296)
