# Comparison with other methods

This folder contains the code we used to generate the results using Spectral clustering, DCSBM, and SBM. In particular, the results from weighted SBM and DCSBM are based on the package developped by [Funke T, Becker T (2019) Stochastic block models: A comparison of variants and inference methods. PLoS ONE 14(4): e0215296.] (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215296). The PABM results are based on code by [Koo, John, Minh Tang, and Michael W. Trosset. "Popularity Adjusted Block Models are Generalized Random Dot Product Graphs." Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 32.1 (2023): 131-144.]
