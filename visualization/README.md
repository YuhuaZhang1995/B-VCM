# Visualization of the results

We show here the code to generate the main results in the paper, which includes: 

(1) Table 1 and Figure 2: the L2 norm of the block labels and the spaghetti plot

Use *l2_norm.r* with example data *cluster.txt* and *truth.txt* will generate the L2 norm plot.

(2) Figure 3: the spaghetti plot of the model selection

Use *spaghetti.r* with example data

(3) Figure 4 and Figure 5(c): degree distribution (Example data: Figure4.txt);

(4) Figure 5(a): visualization of adjacency matrix (Example data: Figure5a.txt);

(5) Figure 5(b): visualization of the bunary matrix (Example data: Figure5b.txt);

(6) Table 3: Hellinger distance (Example data: Table3.txt)
