# Visualization of the results

We show here the code to generate the main results in the paper, which includes: 

(1) Table 1 and Figure 2: the L2 norm of the block labels and the spaghetti plot

Use *l2_norm.r* with example data *cluster.txt* and *truth.txt* will generate the L2 norm plot.

(2) Figure 3: the spaghetti plot of the model selection

Figure 3 is the spaghetti plot of the log likelihoods in different models. Use *llk.r* with example data "llk.txt" will calculate the mean llk to generate the spaghetti plot.

(3) Figure 4 and Figure 5(c): degree distribution;

Use *deg_plot.r* with example data *truth.txt* will generate the degree distribution plot.

(4) Figure 5(a): visualization of adjacency matrix (Example data: Figure5a.txt)



(5) Figure 5(b): visualization of the bunary matrix (Example data: Figure5b.txt);

(6) Table 3: Hellinger distance (Example data: Table3.txt)
