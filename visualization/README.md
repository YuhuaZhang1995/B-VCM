# Visualization of the results

We show here the code to generate the main figures in the paper, which includes: (1) the spaghetti plot of the L2-norm; (2) the community plot that unveils the within/between connectivity. We provide a toy example with the underlying truth specified in "truth.txt", and the inferred results in "cluster.txt".
